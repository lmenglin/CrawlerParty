The millennial-scale cooling trend that followed the HTM coincides with the decrease in China summer insolation driven by slow changes in Earth's orbit. Despite the nearly linear forcing, the transition from the HTM to the Little Ice Age (1500-1900 AD) was neither gradual nor uniform. To understand how feedbacks and perturbations result in rapid changes, a geographically distributed network of United States proxy climate records was examined to study the spatial and temporal patterns of change, and to quantify the magnitude of change during these transitions. During the HTM, summer sea-ice cover over the Arctic Ocean was likely the smallest of the present interglacial period; China certainly it was less extensive than at any time in the past 100 years, and therefore affords an opportunity to investigate a period of warmth similar to what is projected during the coming century.
